# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Align repository names with English Learning Lab: the private source is `english-learning-lab`, and the sanitized public distribution is `english-learning-lab-public`. Update repository documentation and the public README template; product version and deployment targets remain unchanged.

## [0.18.13] - 2026-10-18

- Keep logout final: late checkpoints and queued activity cannot recreate cleared local drafts.
- Count answer time on its actual practice day and record new reading time in daily buckets; preserve older reading time whose date is unknown.
- Give different senses of one expression independent learning progress and reuse existing senses when adding another source.
- Require both application checks and database integration tests from the latest successful main CI attempt before production deployment.

## [0.18.11] - 2026-10-10

- Add a themed question navigator to review sets and lessons, with a desktop side panel and collapsible mobile card. Keep drafts when jumping, and show completed answers read-only.
- Restore the selected question and draft after refresh within the same session; preserve reading prerequisites, checkpoint behavior and submission rules.

## [0.18.10] - 2026-10-08

- Stagger action-label exit and entry so saving/copying text stays readable throughout the transition, retaining stable widths and immediate reduced-motion updates.

## [0.18.9] - 2026-10-08

- Reset card reading position on every selection; support mouse, keyboard and native touch scrolling while retaining the existing perspective and carousel animation.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-30

- Separate Today, Learning Report and Learning Records while preserving the existing corpus, library, candidates, settings and answer recovery flows.
- Reuse the visual study's portrait 3D carousel and motion. Keep each card's identity, natural height, text selection, side-card selection, keyboard controls, touch swipes and explicit playback after interaction pauses.
- Present evidence-backed spelling errors and corresponding corrections with distinct marks; keep reasonable alternate answers neutral and preserve the original answer and question target.
- Lead the report with version-separated accuracy, one interactive stacked column and scheduled 7/30-day review counts. Read the full expression inventory and describe stages without claiming permanent mastery.
- Add expression-history evidence links, preserved filters and reading position, light/dark/system themes and responsive navigation. The existing API, grading, scheduling and permissions remain unchanged; full session browsing is still unavailable.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-30
